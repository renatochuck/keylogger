🌟 **Educational Keylogger - For Learning Purposes** 🌟

🔑 This is a **Python-based keylogger** designed for **educational purposes only**. It demonstrates the workings of a keylogger to help learners and security professionals understand how they operate and how to defend against such threats.

### 🚀 Features:
- **Keystroke Logging**: Logs key presses in an encrypted format 💻🔒
- **Screenshot Capture**: Takes periodic screenshots 📸
- **Clipboard Monitoring**: Logs changes to the clipboard 📝
- **Process Monitoring**: Tracks running processes 🔄
- **Network Monitoring**: Monitors network connections 🌐
- **Persistence**: Ensures the keylogger starts with the system 🚀
- **Encryption**: Encrypts captured data for secure logging 🔐

### 🧑‍💻 Requirements:
- **Python 3.x**
- `pynput`, `pyautogui`, `pyperclip`, `psutil`, `cryptography`, `requests`, `pywin32`

To install the necessary dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install pynput pyautogui pyperclip psutil cryptography requests pywin32
```

---

### 🚀 Running the Keylogger:

1. **Clone the Repo**:
   ```bash
   https://github.com/renatochuck/keylogger.git.git
   cd /keylogger
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install pynput pyautogui pyperclip psutil cryptography requests pywin32
   ```

3. **Run the Script**:
   ```bash
   python keylogger_script.py
   ```

### ⚙️ How It Works:
- **Keystroke Logging**: Logs encrypted keystrokes 🔐
- **Screenshot Capture**: Takes screenshots every 60 seconds 📸
- **Clipboard Monitoring**: Tracks clipboard content 📋
- **Process & Network Monitoring**: Monitors processes and network connections 🔍
- **Persistence**: Ensures the keylogger starts on system boot ⚡

---

### ✋ How to Stop:
- Manually stop by pressing `CTRL+C` in your terminal.
- The keylogger will also remove itself from startup.

---

### 🎓 **Educational Purpose**:
This project helps you understand how keyloggers work and the risks involved. Learn about:
- Encryption using `Fernet` 🔐
- Capturing keystrokes, clipboard, and system activity 🖥️
- Implementing persistence in malware 💻
- Securing systems against keylogger attacks 🔒
